Dear M.Eng. Jiangyu,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of attending a make-up 
session for the ISS class that is cancelled this Friday due to the 
holiday.
Would it be possible for me to attend the Thursday session of your class 
this week ? Thank you for considering my request.

With regards,
Filip Botlo.
